Hello world tutorial for GitHub

I am a data scienctist interessted in developing a deeper understanding of machine learning and atrificial intelligence so that we may more accurately use the tools for exploratory research. 

I have a doctorate in physics where my main area of research was black hole physics. I am currently working as a Post Doc and investigating the applicability of machine learning to high energy physics.
